The Ethereum blockchain provides an immutable ledger of all transactions that occur on the blockchain. This means that all Moonbirds NFTs are outside of the control of any one party, including PROOF, and are subject to many risks and uncertainties. PROOF neither owns nor controls MetaMask, WalletConnect, the Ethereum network, your browser, or any other third party site, product, or service (including third party wallets or marketplaces) that you might access, visit, or use for the purpose of enabling you to use the Services or to purchase, list, auction, or sell Moonbirds NFTs (“Transaction”), and that, except with respect to transferring control of a Moonbirds NFT to the initial purchaser through the Services (“Initial Purchaser”), PROOF has no responsibility with respect to any Transaction. PROOF will not be liable for the acts or omissions of any third parties, nor will PROOF be liable for any damage that you may suffer as a result of your transactions or any other interaction with any third parties. You understand that your Ethereum public address will be made publicly visible whenever you engage in a Transaction. Aside from transferring control of the Moonbirds NFT to the Initial Purchaser, PROOF has no control over the transfer, storage, ownership or maintenance of the Moonbirds NFT.</p><h2 class="font-sans my-5">Changes to services</h2><p class="font-sans my-2 font-[300]">PROOF reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services (or any part thereof) with or without notice. You agree that PROOF will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of the Services, including in relation to any Moonbirds NFT.</p><h2 class="font-sans my-5">PROOF Perks</h2><p class="font-sans my-2 font-[300]">A Collector (as defined below) of a Moonbirds NFT may receive special perks, experience, or opportunities as determined by PROOF in its sole discretion (“Perks”) after the Moonbirds NFTs are first made available for sale (i.e., dropped) by PROOF. PROOF does not make any representation or guarantee that any Collector will receive any Perks or achieve any particular outcome as a result of owning any Moonbirds NFT. PROOF reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to restrict, limit, or deny any Perks to any Collector, including to limit the period of time when a Perk is available, for any reason, at any time. Perks are not intended to be an endorsement of any project, creator, NFT, individual or any other thing, and PROOF makes no recommendation and provides no investment advice in connection with any Perks or otherwise as a result of holding or owning the Moonbirds NFT.</p><h2 class="font-sans my-5">Connecting your wallet</h2><p class="font-sans my-2 font-[300]">In order to access and use the Services, including engaging in a Transaction on the Services, you must connect your account to your digital wallet supported on MetaMask, WalletConnect or other wallet extensions or gateways as allowed on the Services. Such digital wallets allow you to purchase, store, and engage in transactions using the native Ethereum cryptocurrency, ETH. When you link your cryptocurrency wallet, you understand and agree that you are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your wallet and your control over any wallet-related authentication credentials, private or public cryptocurrency keys, non-fungible tokens or cryptocurrencies that are stored in or are accessible through your wallet. Any unauthorized access to your cryptocurrency wallet by third parties could result in the loss or theft of Moonbirds NFTs and/or funds held in your wallet and any associated wallets, including any linked financial information such as bank account(s) or credit card(s). PROOF is not responsible for managing and maintaining the security of your cryptocurrency wallet. PROOF has no responsibility or liability to you for any unauthorized access to or use of your cryptocurrency wallet or if you are unable to locate your credentials. If you notice any unauthorized or suspicious activity in your cryptocurrency wallet that seems to be related to the Services, please notify us immediately.</p><h2 class="font-sans my-5">Sale of moonbirds NFT</h2><p class="font-sans my-2 font-[300]">When each Moonbirds NFT is sold for the first time, the agreement for sale is between PROOF and the Initial Purchaser. If the Initial Purchaser decides to sell a Moonbirds NFT (“Secondary Sale”), then PROOF is not a party to any agreement between the applicable buyer, seller, or facilitator of the Secondary Sale.</p><p class="font-sans my-2 font-[300]">If you or any owner of a Moonbirds NFT (“Collector”) sells or transfers a Moonbirds NFT to another collector, (a) then you, as Collector, represent and warrant that you will notify the subsequent collector of these Terms and require the subsequent collector to comply with these Terms, (b) the Collector License (as defined below) as set forth herein will automatically transfer to such subsequent collector, and such other collector will be deemed the “Collector” (for purposes of such Moonbirds NFT and the Collector License to the underlying Art (as defined below)) and will be subject to these Terms, and (c) you, as the seller or transferor of such Moonbirds NFT, will cease to have any further rights to such Moonbirds NFT or underlying Art.</p><p class="font-sans my-2 font-[300]">By placing an order on the Site or through the Services (including by bidding in an auction), you agree that you are submitting a binding offer to purchase a Moonbirds NFT, you agree to pay all applicable fees associated with the Transaction, and you authorize PROOF to automatically charge and collect such fees from your payment instrument or wallet. If you are an Initial Purchaser, then all amounts due are to be paid to PROOF. If you are not the Initial Purchaser of a Moonbirds NFT, then amounts may be paid to the seller of such Moonbirds NFT.</p><p class="font-sans my-2 font-[300]">You acknowledge and agree that PROOF receives 5.0% of every Secondary Sale of a Moonbirds NFT (“Royalty”). PROOF has the right to collect Royalties for PROOF sales in perpetuity. As such, if you sell a Moonbirds NFT on a third-party marketplace, you agree to include a statement substantially similar to the following in the description of the NFT: “5.0% Royalty Applies. By purchasing a Moonbirds NFT, you agree to the Terms of Use located at https://moonbirds.xyz/terms”</p><p class="font-sans my-2 font-[300]">No refunds are permitted except with respect to any statutory warranties or guaranties that cannot be excluded or limited by law.</p><h2 class="font-sans my-5">Taxes</h2><p class="font-sans my-2 font-[300]">You are responsible for any and all sales, use, value-added and other taxes, duties, and assessments now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental authority, associated with your use of the Services, Perks or Moonbirds NFTs (including, without limitation, any taxes that may become payable as the result of your ownership, transfer, purchase, or sale of a Moonbirds NFT).</p><h2 class="font-sans my-5">PROOF Intellectual Property Rights</h2><p class="font-sans my-2 font-[300]">You acknowledge and agree that the Services may contain content or features (“Services Content”) that are protected by copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, or other proprietary rights and laws. Except as expressly authorized by PROOF, you agree not to modify, copy, frame, scrape, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services or the Services Content, in whole or in part. Any use of the Services or the Services Content other than as specifically authorized herein is strictly prohibited.</p><p class="font-sans my-2 font-[300]">PROOF&#x27;s name and logos, including the terms PROOF and MOONBIRDS, are trademarks and service marks of PROOF (collectively the “PROOF Trademarks”). Other company, product, and service names and logos used and displayed via the Services may be trademarks or service marks of their respective owners who may or may not endorse or be affiliated with or connected to PROOF. All of these rights are expressly reserved in the name of PROOF and/or its affiliates. Nothing in these Terms or the Services should be construed as granting, by implication, estoppel, or otherwise, any license or right to use any of PROOF Trademarks or, other than the rights to the Art (as set forth below), any other intellectual property of PROOF, without PROOF&#x27;s prior written permission in each instance. All rights in such intellectual property are reserved by PROOF and/or its affiliates, and all goodwill generated from the use of PROOF Trademarks will inure to our exclusive benefit.</p><h2 class="font-sans my-5">RIGHTS TO MOONBIRDS NFTS YOU OWN</h2><p class="font-sans my-2 font-[300]">Personal Use. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, PROOF grants you a worldwide, royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the digital art represented by your Moonbirds NFT (“Art”), along with any extensions that you choose to create or use, solely for the following purposes: (i) for your own personal, non-commercial use; (ii) as part of a marketplace that permits the purchase and sale of your Moonbirds NFT, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each Moonbirds NFT owner’s rights to display the Art for their Moonbirds NFT to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art; or (iii) as part of a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of your Moonbirds NFT, provided that the website/application cryptographically verifies each Moonbirds NFT owner’s rights to display the Art for their Moonbirds NFT to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Moonbirds NFT leaves the website/application.</p><p class="font-sans my-2 font-[300]">Commercial Use. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, PROOF grants you a worldwide license to use, copy, and display the Art represented by your Moonbirds NFT for the purpose of creating derivative works based upon the Art (“Commercial Use”). Examples of such Commercial Use would be the use of the Art to produce and sell merchandise products (e.g., T-Shirts etc.) displaying copies of the Art. For the sake of clarity, nothing in this Section will be deemed to restrict you from (i) owning or operating a marketplace that permits the use and sale of Moonbirds NFT generally, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each Moonbirds NFT owner’s rights to display the Art for their Moonbirds NFT to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art; (ii) owning or operating a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of Moonbirds NFT generally, provided that the third party website or application cryptographically verifies each Moonbirds NFT owner’s rights to display the Art for their Moonbirds NFT to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Moonbirds NFT leaves the website/application; or (iii) earning revenue from any of the foregoing.</p><h2 class="font-sans my-5">NO PROFESSIONAL ADVICE; TRANSACTION RISKS</h2><p class="font-sans my-2 font-[300]">The information on this Site and any information provided in connection with the Services or Perks are provided to Moonbirds NFT owners only and for information only and do not constitute, and should not be construed as, professional advice or a recommendation to purchase, sell, trade, or otherwise transact in any digital asset including any products or services or an invitation, offer or solicitation to engage in any purchase, sale, trade, or other transaction with respect to any digital asset.</p><p class="font-sans my-2 font-[300]">The information on this Site and any information provided in connection with the Services or Perks provided to Moonbirds NFT owners are provided solely on the basis that you will make your own transaction decisions, and PROOF does not take account of any person&#x27;s financial or other objectives, particular needs, or financial situation.

It is strongly recommended that you seek professional advice before making any transaction decision. Any decision that you make should be based on an assessment of your risks in consultation with your professional adviser(s).</p><p class="font-sans my-2 font-[300]">The digital assets about which information is provided on the Site and any information provided in connection with the Services or Perks provided to Moonbirds NFT owners are not viewed by the issuer or sponsor of any such digital assets, or those buying or selling the digital asset, as securities under U.S. laws or relevant applicable laws. As a result it is unlikely that fulsome disclosures from the issuer or sponsor, or any executive officer associated with the digital asset or related protocol have been provided, and others may have better or more information than the information made available to you via the Site, or any information provided in connection with the Services or Perks provided to Moonbirds NFT owners or to which you may independently have access.</p><p class="font-sans my-2 font-[300]">There are risks associated with purchasing and holding digital assets.

Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect Moonbirds NFTs, which may also be subject to significant price volatility. Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of Moonbirds NFTs. Moonbirds NFTs are not legal tender and are not backed by any government. Transactions of Moonbirds NFTs may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable. Some Transactions of Moonbirds NFTs shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that you initiated the Transaction. The value of Moonbirds NFTs may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange fiat currency or digital assets for Moonbirds NFTs, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular Moonbirds NFT.</p><p class="font-sans my-2 font-[300]">You agree and understand that you are solely responsible for determining the nature, potential value, suitability, and appropriateness of these risks for yourself, and that we do not give advice or recommendations regarding Moonbirds NFTs, including the suitability and appropriateness of, and investment strategies for, Moonbirds NFTs.

The Notice to PROOF should be sent to PROOF - 5331 S Macadam Ave #258-202, Portland, OR 97239 (“Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If PROOF and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or PROOF may commence an arbitration proceeding.

For information on the AAA, please visit its website, http://www.adr.org. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA&#x27;s consumer arbitration page, https://www.adr.org/consumer. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under these Terms and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.</p><p class="font-sans my-2 font-[300]">Unless PROOF and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination will be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, PROOF agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.</p><p class="font-sans my-2 font-[300]"><b class="font-bold">Costs of Arbitration</b><br/>Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement. To the extent any Arbitration Fees are not specifically allocated to either PROOF or you under the AAA Rules, PROOF and you shall split them equally; provided that if you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of such Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of any Arbitration Fees, PROOF will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, PROOF will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Any payment of attorneys&#x27; fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.</p><p class="font-sans my-2 font-[300]"><b class="font-bold">Confidentiality</b><br/>All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.</p><p class="font-sans my-2 font-[300]"><b class="font-bold">Severability</b><br/>If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection above titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement will be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of subsection above titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement will be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of these Terms will continue to apply.</p><p class="font-sans my-2 font-[300]"><b class="font-bold">Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement</b><br/>Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, PROOF agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a User of the Services, you may reject any such change by sending PROOF written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</p><h2 class="font-sans my-5">NOTICE FOR CALIFORNIA USERS</h2><p class="font-sans my-2 font-[300]">Notice for California Users Under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, Users of the Services from California are entitled to the following specific consumer rights notice: The Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs may be contacted (a) via email at dca@dca.ca.gov; (b) in writing at: Department of Consumer Affairs, Consumer Information Division, 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112, Sacramento, CA 95834; or (c) by telephone at (800) 952-5210 or (800) 326-2297 (TDD).
